##  Process 

### **1. Data Cleaning**

Performed in **Excel** using Power Query and manual edits:

  * Filled blanks with ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù for `country` and `director`.
  * Removed blank rows for critical analysis columns.
* Split and trimmed text (e.g., cast column).
* Standardized date formats and extracted month/year from `date_added`.

### **2. Data Transformation**

* Converted `duration` into **two categories**: minutes (movies) and seasons (TV shows).
* Extracted **month** for seasonal trend analysis.
* Grouped genres from the `listed_in` column.

### **3. Pivot Table Analysis**

Created Pivot Tables to analyze:

1. Movies vs TV Show distribution
2. Titles added over time (Yearly Trend)
3. Top 4 countries by number of titles

## **üìà Key Insights**

Overall Content Overview
* Total Titles: 8,780

* Movies: 6,110 (70%)

* TV Shows: 2,670 (30%)

* Netflix offers more than twice as many movies as TV shows.

 * Content Growth Trends
Titles Added Over Time show a growth peak around 2019‚Äì2020, followed by a decline post-2020.

This suggests a possible shift in Netflix‚Äôs content strategy or reduced licensing/new productions after COVID-19 pandemic peaks.

##  Top Contributing Countries 
United States: 3,202 titles (largest contributor)

India: 1,004 titles

UK & Unknown origins make up the rest of the top four.

This indicates strong dominance of US-based content, but also growing representation from India.

## Popular Genres 
Top genres include Dramas, Comedies, Action & Adventure, Documentaries, and International TV Shows.

Dramas lead with 1,592 titles, suggesting strong viewer demand.

##  Ratings Distribution 
TV-MA (Mature Audience) content forms 46% of titles, followed by TV-14 (31%).
This indicates Netflix leans heavily toward adult and teenage audience content.

Actors with Most Titles
Shah Rukh Khan tops with 26 titles, followed by Akshay Kumar (23).

Strong presence of Bollywood actors aligns with India‚Äôs growing role in Netflix‚Äôs library.

Monthly Additions
The recent months show a slight downward trend in Monthly Content Additions, which may indicate slower expansion.

Average Duration
Movies: ~100 minutes

TV Shows: Average ~1‚Äì2 seasons

This reflects standard streaming content norms.

## Recommendations
 Balance Content Mix

Increase TV show production/acquisition to balance the current 70% movies vs. 30% TV shows split. TV shows often drive longer subscription retention.

Global Content Strategy

Continue expanding Indian and international content to appeal to diverse audiences.

Explore more African, Middle Eastern, and Latin American productions to tap into emerging markets.

Genre Expansion

Documentaries and International TV Shows are growing niches‚Äîinvest more here to capture loyal, niche audiences.

## Target Younger Demographics

With 46% content being TV-MA, there‚Äôs room to produce more family-friendly and kids‚Äô content to broaden audience base.

## Monitor Release Trends

Investigate why title additions dropped after 2020‚Äîthis could be due to licensing costs, competition, or market saturation. Adjust release calendar to maintain engagement.

Leverage Star Power

Promote content with high-appearance actors (e.g., Shah Rukh Khan, Akshay Kumar) in marketing campaigns for regions with large fan bases.
